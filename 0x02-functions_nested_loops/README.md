# My GitHub Repository

## Description

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This project is designed to help you understand and work with various programming concepts, including:

- **Nested Loops:** Nested loops are a fundamental programming construct where one loop is placed inside another. They are used to iterate over elements in a two-dimensional array or to perform repetitive tasks within a certain pattern. Learn how to use nested loops effectively and when they are most appropriate.

- **Functions:** Functions are blocks of code that can be called multiple times to perform specific tasks or computations. In this project, we explore what functions are, how to define and call them, and why they are essential for modular and maintainable code.

- **Declaration vs. Definition:** We delve into the difference between declaring and defining functions. A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters, while a definition provides the actual implementation of the function.

- **Prototypes:** Function prototypes are declarations that provide just enough information about a function to allow the compiler to perform type checking. We discuss why prototypes are necessary and how they are used.

- **Scope of Variables:** Understand variable scope, including global and local scopes. Learn how variable scope impacts how and where variables can be accessed in your code.

- **GCC Flags:** Explore essential GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) flags such as `-Wall`, `-Werror`, `-pedantic`, `-Wextra`, and `-std=gnu89`. These flags help ensure code quality, portability, and adherence to language standards.

- **Header Files:** Header files are used to declare functions, constants, and data structures for use in multiple source code files. We show you how to create and use header files with the `#include` directive to organize and modularize your code effectively.
